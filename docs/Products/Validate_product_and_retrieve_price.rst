.. _validate_product:

Validate product and retrieve price
===================================

To make sure you have an order-able product, you can validate the attributes and values. Send the attributes and values in a ``POST`` request to ``/api/products/{sku}``.

If you can order your product, you will receive the following data: ``price`` and ``promised arrival date``

**Small note, the delivery days are working days, so holidays and weekends needs to be added to get the actual date.**

If the product is invalid, you will retrieve a 400 status code.
