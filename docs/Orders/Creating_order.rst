You can create an order by sending the order information in JSON as a ``POST`` request to ``/api/orders``.

The following can be used as an example to create an order:

.. literalinclude:: ../code_examples/Orders/Creating_order/Create_order.json
   :language: JSON
   :linenos:

The response will be a JSON object with the order UUID that can be used to retrieve information from the order:

.. code-block:: JSON
   :linenos:

    {
        "uuid": "fea079fc-2f77-4223-9d5f-10254bb48717"
    }

*******
Payment
*******

The payment method for this order is on account. You will receive the invoice by email.

Order has failed

The Printdeal API was updated at 21 December 2018 around 13:00, after this time, when an order creation failed and you retrieve the order, you now receive an 404 result, with an error message that the order creation has failed. Orders that failed before this date and time will have a 404 not found response.
